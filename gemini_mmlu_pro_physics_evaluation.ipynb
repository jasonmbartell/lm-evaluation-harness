    "**Important Configuration Notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base URL:** Must include the full endpoint path `/chat/completions`, not just the base path\n",

    "   - Incorrect: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tokenizer Configuration:**\n",
    "   - Gemini's OpenAI compatibility layer doesn't support the `/tokenizer_info` endpoint\n",
    "   - Use `tokenizer_backend=\"huggingface\"` with `tokenizer=\"Xenova/gpt-4\"`\n",
    "   - Do NOT use `tokenizer_backend=\"tiktoken\"` (tiktoken doesn't recognize Gemini models)\n",
    "   - Do NOT use `tokenizer_backend=\"remote\"` (endpoint not supported)\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative tokenizers you can try:\n",
    "- `\"Xenova/gpt-4o\"` - For newer models\n",
    "- `\"gpt2\"` - For simpler tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The tokenizer is only used for calculating token counts locally and doesn't affect the actual API requests to Gemini."

    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to:\n",
    "1. Configure and use Gemini models with lm-evaluation-harness\n",
    "2. Run evaluations programmatically using `simple_evaluate()`\n",
    "3. Analyze and visualize results\n",
    "4. Save results for further analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to your Gemini API key\n",
    "- Use `local-chat-completions` model type with Gemini's OpenAI-compatible endpoint\n",
    "- Always set `apply_chat_template=True` for chat models\n",
    "- Batch size must be 1 for chat completions\n",
    "- Use `limit=10` for quick testing before running full evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- Try other MMLU Pro subjects: `mmlu_pro_chemistry`, `mmlu_pro_math`, etc.\n",
    "- Run all MMLU Pro tasks: `tasks=[\"mmlu_pro\"]`\n",
    "- Experiment with different models: `gemini-2.5-pro`, `gemini-2.0-flash`\n",
    "- Adjust few-shot examples: `num_fewshot=0` (zero-shot) or `num_fewshot=10`"
